# loan-calculator

API service running on port 3001. This port can be changed by setting the env variable "PORT".

For now two GET endpoints are defined:
http://localhost:3001/monthlyPayment
http://localhost:3001/totalRent

To build the code and prepare it to run:
npm install

To start the service:
npm start

To run the tests:
npm test

To run the linter:
npm run lint


Optimally we run these every time we commit...
